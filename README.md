# 74HC595-7SegmentDisplay-CPP
Control your 7Segment Displays with 74HC595 shift register however you want with predefined letters

You can call test function in loop to see how it works.
Due to shift registers work left to right; While using more than one shift registers the master shift register must control the last display because it will store the last digit
